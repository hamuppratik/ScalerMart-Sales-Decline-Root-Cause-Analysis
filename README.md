ScalerMart Sales Decline Root Cause Analysis

Objective:

In this project, my goal was to analyze customer-level transactional data for ScalerMart, a global electronics retailer, to understand the reasons behind a nearly 50% decline in revenue in 2020 compared to the previous year. The objective was to recommend data-driven strategies to improve sales performance.

Key Tasks:

- Data Exploration and Cleaning:

- Data Cleaning: I started by cleaning and sanitizing the provided data to ensure its quality before analysis. This involved handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and addressing any outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I explored the distribution of customer demographics using visualization techniques such as histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots to understand patterns and relationships within the data.

- User Segmentation

  Segmentation Techniques: I recommended clustering techniques to group customers with similar characteristics. This included segmenting customers based on factors influencing their purchase behavior and analyzing purchase patterns within each segment to identify any significant differences.
Importance of Segmentation: Segmentation was crucial for understanding diverse customer behaviors and tailoring marketing strategies effectively.

- Engagement Analysis:

  - Customer Loyalty Metric: I devised a metric to quantify customer loyalty by analyzing repeat purchases and tracking trends over time.
  - Demographic Analysis: I correlated user demographics with purchase behavior to identify patterns and tested hypotheses to find statistically significant relationships.

Business Insights:

  - Economic Downturn: The significant drop in sales from 2019 to 2020 was likely due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, reducing consumer spending.
  Customer Churn: Segmentation revealed a notable number of "Lost Customers" and "At Risk Customers," indicating potential churn issues.
  - Seasonal Effects: Fluctuations in monthly sales suggested possible seasonal effects and a lack of consistent promotional campaigns during peak periods.
  - Product Issues: Price sensitivity analysis indicated that higher prices might be deterring purchases, as there was a negative correlation between price and quantity sold.
  - Geographical Concentration: Sales were concentrated in the United States, particularly California, which may have impacted overall sales when that region's economy was affected.

Recommendations:

- Enhance Customer Retention Programs:

- Loyalty Programs: Implement and enhance loyalty programs to reward repeat purchases and offer personalized discounts to loyal customers.
Reactivation Campaigns: Target "Lost Customers" and "At Risk Customers" with special promotions to encourage their return.
Dynamic Pricing Strategies:

- Implement dynamic pricing based on demand and competitor pricing. Use price elasticity analysis to find optimal pricing that maximizes sales while maintaining profit margins.

- Seasonal Promotions:

  Launch targeted promotions during peak seasons based on historical sales data to boost revenue during high-sales periods.

- Geographical Expansion:

  Expand marketing efforts to other regions and countries to diversify the customer base. Use targeted advertising to reach potential customers in underrepresented areas.
Product Portfolio Optimization:

  Analyze product performance, discontinue low-performing items, and focus on promoting best-sellers and high-demand products.

- Customer Feedback Loop:

  Establish a feedback mechanism to gather insights on customer preferences and pain points. Use this feedback to enhance products and services.

- RFM-Based Marketing:

  Utilize RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers and tailor marketing strategies:

  Best Customers: Upsell and cross-sell premium products.

  Promising Customers: Offer incentives to increase purchase frequency.

  New Customers: Provide a welcoming experience and encourage repeat purchases with introductory offers.
